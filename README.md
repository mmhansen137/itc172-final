When nothing was metaphorically on fire, I spent most of my time making and

This effort bogged-down, since I knew it wouldn't be adopted by others if
it depended on all interactions taking place through a Lisp REPL. I looked
at options for building GUIs, and all seemed complex, fragile to changes in
their dependencies, and above all, poorly documented.
