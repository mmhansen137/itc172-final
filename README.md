They say, write what you know, so maybe I should code what I know, as well?

I'd begin at the beginning, but I don't have several weeks to explain. Before
my dramatic decline from employed and productive to lurking in a dark basement,
my duties included keeping track of servers, routers, switches, patchbays,
wall jacks, and just shy of 10 miles of Cat5e cable running through the walls
and ceilings on two floors of a Bellevue office tower. This information was
represented with TSV files kept on an old Sun stashed in the NOC, and my
tools to work with those files were vi and awk. Over time, I began to wonder
if, perhaps, there might be tools better suited to the task. I think I've
found them, 11 years after the company collapsed.
